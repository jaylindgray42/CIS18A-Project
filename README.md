# CIS18A-Project
This is the program that I designed for my CIS18A class project assignment. It comes in a package titled FarmFoodsProducts and includes two files: 

1.ProductData.java

2.OrderCost.java

This is the first version of the program so far and it is developed by me (name is in username) on February 13, 2020.

Summary:

-The purpose of this program is to list what products a fictional store called Farm Foods need to be ordered based on the amount of product currently in stock compared to the amount required to satisfy current consumer demands. The second file (OrderCost), details how much each new order of products will cost Farm Foods based on the order amount needed and the price of the product per unit weight. 

Instructions:

-To use the first program (ProductData), simply follow the instructions that appear when you run it on the command line after compiling it with javac. The program reads input from the keyboard in order to relay the information, enter two letters in the same line in order to access the respective sub-category. There are 4 main categories: Meat, Dairy, Vegetables, and Fruit (each represented by the letter they start with). And there are 13 sub-categories which must be accessed in order to see the full system output.

Example:
 MC

-To use the second program, simply run it on the commmand line after compiling it with javac. It will then display the cost information.
